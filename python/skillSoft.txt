Data Structures & Algorithms in Python: Fundamental…    Done
    - measurment performance
    - Big O notation
    - O(1)  complexity does not change with the input size, same constant execution time
    - O(N)  complexity (time by algorithm increases) linearly when N increases
    - O(Nx2) complexity increases quadratically when N increases

    - Linked list complexity:
        O(N) insert to end
        O(1) insert to begining
        O(N) find in linked list
        O(1) deleting of first element
        O(N) deleting of random element
        O(N) reversal

    - Stack: LIFO principle
        O(1) PUSH, POP, SIZE, ISEMPTY, ISFULL, SIZE  (PEEK)

    - Queue: FIFO add to end, remove from top ?
        O(1) ENQUEUE(add), DEQUEUE(rem), ISEMPTY, ISFULL
        O(N) SPACE complexity 

Data Structures & Algorithms in Python: Implementing data structures    Done


Data Structures & Algorithms in Python: Sorting Algorithms  Done
    - Selection sort
        O(N2)  find smallest, get into first pos, re-iterate

    - Bubble sort
        O(N2) biggest element swapped to the right place of array

    - Insertion sort
        O(N2) compare with prev element, move to left if less (dynamical sorted sublist)

    - Shell sort
        O(N)<-->O(N2) Divide to sublists, use insertion sort for each sublist, then insertion sort
        on whole list created from sublists

    - Merge sort
        O(nlogn) List broken into smaller and smaller resursively, then merge back smallest
        sublists. Recursion algorithm. 

    - Quick sort  (binary division sort)
        O(nlogn) Pivot value, all elements less them pivot got to left most place, larger
        pivot got to right 


Data Structures & Algorithms in Python: Trees & Graphs   Done
    -  Binary search: 
        O(log n)  take index in middle of sorted, all left are less, all right are larger

    - Binary tree: non linear structure
        each node: 0, 1 or 2 children
        root, edge (2 adj: parent and child),  
        leaf (no children), 
        sibling node (same parents)
        root: ancestor 

    - Binary ordered tree:  left branch , all less root, right branch all larger then root

    - Balanced tree: when number of elements in left and right about the same

    - Min value: left most value in tree.
    - Maximum depth: max distance from the root
    - Sum path: sum of all node values in path
    - Breadth first / Depth first traversal
    - Graph
